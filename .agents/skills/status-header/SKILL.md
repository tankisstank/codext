# Status Header

Apply these conventions every time the status header bar is implemented or modified. Treat this skill as defining user-visible behavior, not as permission to update only one code path. Use Stylize helpers and keep the segment order/formatting consistent.

## Scope and synchronization

- Before editing the header, identify every implementation that renders the same user-visible surface. In the current upstream layout this is the app-server-backed `codex-rs/tui` surface.
- If another implementation also exposes the same header, keep them aligned. Do not mark the task complete after changing only one side unless the other side has been intentionally removed upstream or there is a documented reason not to sync it.
- Do not assume the classic `tui` is the runtime path users see. Check the current dispatch path for the target tag/config before deciding which implementation to edit.
- Match behavior first, not plumbing. Different TUI surfaces may use local polling, bootstrap data, or app-server events; any source is acceptable as long as the rendered header stays behaviorally aligned and fresh.

## Layout and spacing

The status header is rendered as the first child of a `ColumnRenderable` inside the bottom
section, directly above the bottom pane (chat composer). To keep the visual rhythm consistent
across the TUI:

- **Top spacing:** The status header row is preceded by a 1-line top inset
  (`Insets::tlbr(/*top*/ 1, …)`), matching the top spacing used by the active cell and active
  hook cell renderables.
- **Bottom spacing:** The status header row is followed by a 1-line bottom inset
  (`Insets::tlbr(…, /*bottom*/ 1, …)`) to separate it from the chat composer below.
- **Left gutter:** The content is left-indented by [`LIVE_PREFIX_COLS`] columns, matching the
  gutter used by the configurable footer `/statusline` and history cells.

When the status header is absent (no content), the bottom pane receives a 1-line top inset
instead, so the composer never sits flush against the transcript area.

## Required color mapping

- Segment order is fixed: model, directory, git, rate limit, account. Omit unavailable segments
  without reordering the remaining visible segments.
- Model segment: icon + label in cyan.
- Directory segment: icon + path in yellow.
- Git segment:
  - icon + branch in blue
  - ahead count in green
  - behind count in red
  - changed count in yellow
  - untracked count in red
- Rate limit segment: icon + summary in cyan.
  - Summary format: `95% 23:19`
- Account segment: label only in cyan, always last when present.
  - ChatGPT account format: `user@example.com(Pro)`
  - API-key auth format: `API key`
- Segment separator: " │ " in dim.

## Reference snippet (behavioral template, adapt to local architecture)

```rust
let mut spans: Vec<Span<'static>> = Vec::new();
let mut push_segment = |segment: Vec<Span<'static>>| {
    if !spans.is_empty() {
        spans.push(" │ ".dim());
    }
    spans.extend(segment);
};

if let Some(model_name) = self.model_name.as_ref() {
    let label = format_model_label(model_name);
    push_segment(vec!["\u{ee9c} ".cyan(), Span::from(label).cyan()]);
}

if let Some(directory) = self.directory.as_ref() {
    push_segment(vec![
        "\u{f07c} ".yellow(),
        Span::from(directory.clone()).yellow(),
    ]);
}

if let Some(git_status) = self.git_status.as_ref() {
    let mut segment = vec![
        "\u{f418} ".blue(),
        Span::from(git_status.branch.clone()).blue(),
    ];
    let ahead = git_status.ahead;
    if ahead > 0 {
        segment.push(Span::from(format!(" ↑{ahead}")).green());
    }
    let behind = git_status.behind;
    if behind > 0 {
        segment.push(Span::from(format!(" ↓{behind}")).red());
    }
    let changed = git_status.changed;
    if changed > 0 {
        segment.push(Span::from(format!(" +{changed}")).yellow());
    }
    let untracked = git_status.untracked;
    if untracked > 0 {
        segment.push(Span::from(format!(" ?{untracked}")).red());
    }
    push_segment(segment);
}

if let Some(summary) = self.rate_limit_summary.as_ref() {
    push_segment(vec!["\u{f464} ".cyan(), Span::from(summary.clone()).cyan()]);
}

if let Some(account_label) = self.account_label.as_ref() {
    push_segment(vec![Span::from(account_label.clone()).cyan()]);
}
```

Use the snippet as a template for segment order, icon usage, and color intent. Adapt field names,
ownership, helper selection, and refresh wiring to the local module instead of cargo-culting the
exact code.

## Usage notes

- Only change colors if this skill explicitly instructs it; do not introduce new colors.
- Keep the separator as dim to avoid competing with the segments.
- Prefer the exact icon codes shown above unless the feature removes a segment entirely.
- If a repo-level lint, style rule, or existing helper abstraction rejects the exact method calls in
  the snippet, keep the same visual result using the repo-approved mechanism instead of forcing the
  snippet verbatim.
- If a status-header segment depends on background-polled or async state (for example rate-limit
  data fetched from `/usage`), the update path must explicitly request a redraw/frame after the
  cached state changes so the header updates while the UI is otherwise idle.
- The redraw requirement applies to every implementation that renders the header. If multiple
  TUI surfaces show the header, each side needs its own refresh path and redraw trigger.
- Do not assume the rate-limit source must be local `/usage` polling; event-driven or
  bootstrap-fed data is acceptable if it keeps the header equivalently fresh.
- In this fork's app-server-backed `codex-rs/tui`, keep ChatGPT rate-limit snapshots fresh with a
  15-second background refresh cadence and redraw the UI after each successful snapshot update.
- Treat the directory segment as the session/thread `cwd`, not the transient `workdir` of an
  individual tool call. Creating or using another git worktree does not change the header by
  itself; the header switches only when the session `cwd` changes.
- When header git state is refreshed asynchronously, key it by the same `cwd` as the directory
  segment. If the session `cwd` changes, retarget polling/refresh to the new `cwd`, clear stale git
  state, and ignore late results from the previous `cwd` so an old worktree cannot overwrite the
  new header context.
